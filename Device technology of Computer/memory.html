			<h2>Computer memory</h2>
			<p>Memory refers to the computer hardware devices used to store information for immediate use in a computer; it is synonymous with the term "primary storage". 
				Computer memory operates at a high speed, for example random-access memory (RAM), as a distinction from storage that provides slow-to-access program and data storage but offers higher capacities. 
				If needed, contents of the computer memory can be transferred to secondary storage, through a memory management technique called "virtual memory". An archaic synonym for memory is store.</p>
			<p>The term "memory", meaning "primary storage" or "main memory", is often associated with addressable semiconductor memory, i.e. integrated circuits consisting of silicon-based transistors,
			used for example as primary storage but also other purposes in computers and other digital electronic devices. There are two main types of semiconductor memory, volatile and non-volatile.
			Examples of non-volatile memory are flash memory (used as secondary memory) and ROM, PROM, EPROM and EEPROM memory (used for storing firmware such as BIOS). 
			Examples of volatile memory are primary storage (typically dynamic RAM, DRAM), and fast CPU cache memory 
			(typically static RAM, SRAM, which is fast but energy-consuming and offer lower memory capacity per area unit than DRAM). </p>
			<p>Most semiconductor memory is organized into memory cells or bistable flip-flops, each storing one bit (0 or 1). 
				Flash memory organization includes both one bit per memory cell and multiple bits per cell (called MLC, Multiple Level Cell). 
				The memory cells are grouped into words of fixed word length, for example 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 bit. Each word can be accessed by a binary address of N bit,
				making it possible to store 2 raised by N words in the memory. This implies that processor registers normally are not considered as memory, 
				since they only store one word and do not include an addressing mechanism. Typical secondary storage devices are hard disk drives and solid-state drives.</p>
			<h4>Volatile memory</h4>
			<p>Volatile memory is computer memory that requires power to maintain the stored information. Most modern semiconductor volatile memory is either static RAM (SRAM) or dynamic RAM (DRAM). 
				SRAM retains its contents as long as the power is connected and is easy for interfacing, but uses six transistors per bit. Dynamic RAM is more complicated for interfacing and control, 
				needing regular refresh cycles to prevent losing its contents, but uses only one transistor and one capacitor per bit, allowing it to reach much higher densities and much cheaper per-bit costs.</p>
			<p>SRAM is not worthwhile for desktop system memory, where DRAM dominates, but is used for their cache memories. SRAM is commonplace in small embedded systems, 
				which might only need tens of kilobytes or less. Forthcoming volatile memory technologies that hope to replace or compete with SRAM and DRAM include Z-RAM, TTRAM, A-RAM and ETA RAM.</p>
			<h4>Non-volatile memory</h4>
			<p>Non-volatile memory is computer memory that can retain the stored information even when not powered. Examples of non-volatile memory include read-only memory (see ROM), flash memory, 
				most types of magnetic computer storage devices (e.g. hard disks, floppy discs and magnetic tape), optical discs, and early computer storage methods such as paper tape and punched cards.</p>
			<p>Forthcoming non-volatile memory technologies include FeRAM, CBRAM, PRAM, SONOS, RRAM, Racetrack memory, NRAM and Millipede.</p>
			<p>A memory module, commonly called RAM, memory, or a RAM chip, is a dynamic random access memory integrated circuit module mounted on a printed circuit board and designed for use in personal computers, 
				workstations, and servers.</p>
			<p>It is used to refer to these specific types of memory modules:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Dual in-line package memory</li>
				<li>TransFlash Memory Module</li>
				<li>SIPP memory, single in-line pin package memory</li>
				<li>SIMM, a single in-line memory module</li>
				<li>DIMM, dual in-line memory module</li>
				<li>Rambus memory modules are a subset of DIMMs, but are usually referred to as RIMMs</li>
				<li>SO-DIMM, small outline DIMM, a smaller version of the DIMM, used in laptops</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Distinguishing characteristics of computer memory modules include voltage, capacity, speed (i.e., bit rate), and form factor.</p>

			<h2>Memory card </h2>
			<p>A memory card or flash card is an electronic flash memory data storage device used for storing digital information. 
				These are commonly used in portable electronic devices, such as digital cameras, mobile phones, laptop computers, tablets, MP3 players and video game consoles.</p>
			<p>PC Cards (PCMCIA) were the first commercial memory card formats (type I cards) to come out, but are now mainly used in industrial applications and to connect I/O devices such as modems. 
				Since 1994, a number of memory card formats smaller than the PC Card arrived, the first one was CompactFlash later SmartMedia and Miniature Card. The desire for smaller cards for cell-phones,
				PDAs, and compact digital cameras drove a trend that left the previous generation of "compact" cards looking big. In digital cameras SmartMedia and CompactFlash had been very successful. 
				In 2001, SM alone captured 50% of the digital camera market and CF had captured the professional digital camera market. By 2005 however, SD/MMC had nearly taken over SmartMedia's spot,
				though not to the same level and with stiff competition coming from Memory Stick variants, as well as CompactFlash. In industrial and embedded fields, even the venerable PC card (PCMCIA)
				memory cards still manage to maintain a niche, while in mobile phones and PDAs, the memory card market was highly fragmented until 2010 when micro-SD came to dominate new high-end phones and tablet computers.</p>
			<p>Since 2010, new products of Sony (previously only using Memory Stick) and Olympus (previously only using XD-Card) have been offered with an additional SD-Card slot. 
				Effectively the format war has turned in SD-Card's favour.</p>
