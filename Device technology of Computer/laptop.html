			<h2>Laptop computer</h2>
			<p>A laptop, often called a notebook, is a portable personal computer with a clamshell form factor, suitable for mobile use.
				Although originally there was a distinction between laptops and notebooks, the former being bigger and heavier than the latter, in modern usage there is often no longer any difference.
				Laptops are commonly used in a variety of settings, such as at work, in education, and for personal multimedia.</p>
			<p>A laptop combines the components and inputs of a desktop computer, including the display, speakers, a keyboard, and pointing devices (such as a touchpad or trackpad) into a single unit. 
				Most modern-day laptops also have integrated webcams and built-in microphones. The device can be powered either from a rechargeable battery or by mains electricity from an AC adapter. 
				Laptops are diverse devices and specialized kinds, such as rugged notebook or convertible computers, have been optimized for specific uses.
				The hardware specifications significantly vary between different types, makes, and models.</p>
			<p>Portable computers, which later developed into modern laptops, were originally considered to be a small niche market, mostly for specialized field applications, such as in the military, 
				for accountancy, or for sales representatives. As portable computers became closer to the modern laptop, they became widely used for a variety of purposes.</p>
			<h4>Advantages</h4>
			<p>Portability is usually the first feature mentioned in any comparison of laptops versus desktop PCs. Physical portability allows that a laptop can be used in many places— not only at home and at the office, 
				but also during commuting and flights, in coffee shops, in lecture halls and libraries, at clients' location or at a meeting room, etc. The portability feature offers several distinct advantages:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Productivity: Using a laptop in places where a desktop PC cannot be used, and at times that would otherwise be wasted. For example, an office worker managing their e-mails during an hour-long commute by train, 
					or a student doing his/her homework at the university coffee shop during a break between lectures.</li>
				<li>Immediacy: Carrying a laptop means having instant access to various information, personal and work files. Immediacy allows better collaboration between co-workers or students, 
					as a laptop can be flipped open to present a problem or a solution anytime, anywhere.</li>
				<li>Up-to-date information: If a person has more than one desktop PC, a problem of synchronization arises: changes made on one computer are not automatically propagated to the others.
					There are ways to resolve this problem, including physical transfer of updated files (using a USB flash memory stick or CDRs) or using synchronization software over the Internet.
					However, using a single laptop at both locations avoids the problem entirely, as the files exist in a single location and are always up-to-date.</li>
				<li>Connectivity: A proliferation of Wi-Fi wireless networks and cellular broadband data services (HSDPA, EVDO and others)
					combined with a near-ubiquitous support by laptops means that a laptop can have easy Internet and local network connectivity while remaining mobile.
					Wi-Fi networks and laptop programs are especially widespread at university campuses.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other advantages of laptops:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Laptops are smaller than desktop PCs. This is beneficial when space is at a premium, for example in small apartments and student dorms. When not in use, a laptop can be closed and put away.</li>
				<li>Low power consumption: Laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20–120 W, compared to 100–800 W for desktops. This could be particularly beneficial for businesses
					(which run hundreds of personal computers, multiplying the potential savings) and homes where there is a computer running 24/7 (such as a home media server, print server, etc.)</li>
				<li>Laptops are often quieter than desktops, due both to the components (quieter, slower 2.5-inch hard drives) and to less heat production leading to use of fewer and slower cooling fans.</li>
				<li>Battery: a charged laptop can continue to be used in case of a power outage and is not affected by short power interruptions and blackouts. 
					A desktop PC needs a UPS to handle short interruptions, blackouts and spikes; achieving on-battery time of more than 20–30 minutes for a desktop PC requires a large and expensive UPS.</li>
				<li>All-in-One: designed to be portable, laptops have everything integrated into the chassis. For desktops (excluding all-in-ones) this is divided into the desktop, keyboard, mouse, display,
					and optional peripherals such as speakers.</li>
