			<h2>Computer buses</h2>
			<p>Computer bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, 
				or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) and software, including communication protocols.</p>
			<p>Early computer buses were parallel electrical wires with multiple connections, but the term is now used for any physical arrangement that provides the same logical functionality as a parallel electrical bus.
				Modern computer buses can use both parallel and bit serial connections, and can be wired in either a multidrop (electrical parallel) or daisy chain topology, or connected by switched hubs, 
				as in the case of USB.</p>
			<h4>Internal bus</h4>
			<p>The internal bus, also known as internal data bus, memory bus, connects all the internal components of a computer, such as CPU and memory, to the motherboard. 
			Internal data buses are also referred to as a local bus, because they are intended to connect to local devices. 
			This bus is typically rather quick and is independent of the rest of the computer operations.</p>
			<h4>External bus</h4>
			<p>The external bus, or expansion bus, is made up of the electronic pathways that connect the different external devices, such as printer etc., to the computer.</p>

			<h2>Motherboard</h2>
			<p>Motherboard (mainboard, mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) found in computers and other expandable systems.
				It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, 
				and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard contains significant sub-systems such as the processor and other components.</p>
			<p>Motherboard specifically refers to a PCB with expansion capability and as the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the "mother" of all components attached to it, 
				which often include sound cards, video cards, network cards, hard drives, or other forms of persistent storage; 
				TV tuner cards, cards providing extra USB or FireWire slots and a variety of other custom components.</p>
			<h4>Form factor</h4>
			<p>Motherboards are produced in a variety of sizes and shapes called computer form factor, some of which are specific to individual computer manufacturers. 
			However, the motherboards used in IBM-compatible systems are designed to fit various case sizes. As of 2007, most desktop computer motherboards use the ATX standard form factor â€” 
			even those found in Macintosh and Sun computers, which have not been built from commodity components. A case's motherboard and PSU form factor must all match, 
			though some smaller form factor motherboards of the same family will fit larger cases. For example, an ATX case will usually accommodate a microATX motherboard.</p>
			<p>Laptop computers generally use highly integrated, miniaturized and customized motherboards. This is one of the reasons that laptop computers are difficult to upgrade and expensive to repair. 
			Often the failure of one laptop component requires the replacement of the entire motherboard, which is usually more expensive than a desktop motherboard due to the large number of integrated components.</p>
			<h4>Integrated peripherals</h4>
			<p>With the steadily declining costs and size of integrated circuits, it is now possible to include support for many peripherals on the motherboard.
				By combining many functions on one PCB, the physical size and total cost of the system may be reduced; highly integrated motherboards are thus especially popular in small form factor and budget computers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>disk controllers for a floppy disk drive, up to 2 PATA drives, and up to 6 SATA drives (including RAID 0/1 support)</li>
				<li>integrated graphics controller supporting 2D and 3D graphics, with VGA and TV output</li>
				<li>integrated sound card supporting 8-channel (7.1) audio and S/PDIF output</li>
				<li>Fast Ethernet network controller for 10/100 MBit networking</li>
				<li>USB 2.0 controller supporting up to 12 USB ports</li>
				<li>IrDA controller for infra-red data communication (e.g. with an IrDA-enabled cellular phone or printer)</li>
				<li>Temperature, voltage, and fan-speed sensors that allow software to monitor the health of computer components.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Peripheral card slots</h4>
			<p>A typical motherboard will have a different number of connections depending on its standard and form factor.</p>
			<p>A standard, modern ATX motherboard will typically have two or three PCI-Express 16x connection for a graphics card, one or two legacy PCI slots for various expansion cards, 
				and one or two PCI-E 1x (which has superseded PCI). A standard EATX motherboard will have two to four PCI-E 16x connection for graphics cards, and a varying number of PCI and PCI-E 1x slots. 
				It can sometimes also have a PCI-E 4x slot (will vary between brands and models).</p>
			<p>Some motherboards have two or more PCI-E 16x slots, to allow more than 2 monitors without special hardware, or use a special graphics technology called SLI (for Nvidia) and Crossfire (for AMD). 
				These allow 2 to 4 graphics cards to be linked together, to allow better performance in intensive graphical computing tasks, such as gaming, video editing, etc.</p>

			<h2>The BIOS</h2>
			<p>The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, 
				and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. 
				Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a de facto standard.</p>
			<p>The fundamental purposes of the BIOS in modern PCs are to initialize and test the system hardware components, and to load a boot loader or an operating system from a mass memory device. 
				The BIOS additionally provides an abstraction layer for the hardware, i.e., a consistent way for application programs and operating systems to interact with the keyboard, display, 
				and other input/output (I/O) devices. Variations in the system hardware are hidden by the BIOS from programs that use BIOS services instead of directly accessing the hardware.</p>
			<p>Most BIOS implementations are specifically designed to work with a particular computer or motherboard model, by interfacing with various devices that make up the complementary system chipset. 
				Originally, BIOS firmware was stored in a ROM chip on the PC motherboard; in modern computer systems, 
				the BIOS contents are stored on flash memory so it can be rewritten without removing the chip from the motherboard. 
				This allows easy updates to the BIOS firmware so new features can be added or bugs can be fixed, but it also creates a possibility for the computer to become infected with BIOS rootkits.</p>
			<p>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) was designed as a successor to BIOS, aiming to address its technical shortcomings. As of 2014, new PC hardware predominantly ships with UEFI firmware.</p>
			<h4>Setup utility</h4>
			<p>Historically, the BIOS in the IBM PC and XT had no built-in user interface. The BIOS versions in earlier PCs (XT-class) were not software configurable; 
				instead, users set the options via DIP switches on the motherboard. Later computers, including all IBM-compatibles with 80286 CPUs, 
				had a battery-backed nonvolatile BIOS memory (CMOS RAM chip) that held BIOS settings.[21] These settings, such as video-adapter type, memory size, 
				and hard-disk parameters, could only be configured by running a configuration program from a disk, not built into the ROM. 
				A special "reference diskette" was inserted in an IBM AT to configure settings such as memory size.</p>
			<p>Early BIOS versions did not have passwords or boot-device selection options. The BIOS was hard-coded to boot from the first floppy drive, or, if that failed, the first hard disk.
				Access control in early AT-class machines was by a physical key lock switch (which was not hard to defeat if the computer case could be opened). Anyone who could switch on the computer could boot it.</p>
			<p>Later, 386-class computers started integrating the BIOS setup utility in the ROM itself, alongside the BIOS code; 
				these computers usually boot into the BIOS setup utility if a certain key or key combination is pressed, otherwise the BIOS POST and boot process are executed.</p>
			<p>A modern BIOS setup utility has a menu-based user interface (UI) accessed by pressing a certain key on the keyboard when the PC starts. Usually the key is advertised for short time during the early startup, 
				for example "Press F1 to enter CMOS setup". The actual key depends on specific hardware. Features present in the BIOS setup utility typically include:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Configuring the hardware components, including setting their various operating modes and frequencies (
				for example, selecting how the storage controllers are visible to the operating system, or overlocking the CPU)</li>
			<li>Setting the system clock</li>
			<li>Enabling or disabling system components</li>
			<li>Selecting which devices are potential boot devices, and in which order booting from them will be attempted</li>
			<li>Setting various passwords, such as a password for securing access to the BIOS user interface functions itself and preventing malicious users from booting the system from unauthorized portable storage devices,
				a password for booting the system, or a hard disk drive password that limits access to it and stays assigned even if the hard disk drive is moved to another computer.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Reprogramming</h4>
			<p>In modern PCs the BIOS is stored in rewritable memory, allowing the contents to be replaced or "rewritten". 
				This rewriting of the contents is sometimes termed flashing, based on the common use of a kind of EEPROM known technically as "flash EEPROM" and colloquially as "flash memory".
				It can be done by a special program, usually provided by the system's manufacturer, or at POST, with a BIOS image in a hard drive or USB flash drive. 
				A file containing such contents is sometimes termed "a BIOS image".	A BIOS might be reflashed in order to upgrade to a newer version to fix bugs or provide improved performance or to support newer hardware, 
				or a reflashing operation might be needed to fix a damaged BIOS.</p>
