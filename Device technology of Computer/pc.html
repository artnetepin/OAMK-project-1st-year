			<h2>Computer</h2>
			<p>Computer generally means a programmable machine. 
				The two principal characteristics of a computer are: it responds to
				a specific set of instructions in a well-defined manner and it can execute a prerecorded list of instructions (a program).</p>
			<p>The actual machinery of the computer — wires, transistors, and circuits — is called hardware; the instructions and data are called software.</p>
			<p>All general-purpose computers require the following hardware components:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="memory.html">Memory</a>: enables a computer to store, at least temporarily, data and programs.</li>
				<li><a href="diskdrive.html">Mass storage device</a>: allows a computer to permanently retain large amounts of data. Common mass storage devices include disk drives and tape drives.</li>
				<li>Input device: usually a keyboard and mouse, the input device is the channel through which data and instructions enter a computer.</li>
				<li>Output device: a display screen, printer, or other device that lets you see what the computer has accomplished.</li>
				<li><a href="cpu.html">Central processing unit (CPU)</a>: the heart of the computer, this is the component that actually executes instructions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to these basic components, many others make it possible for the basic components to work together efficiently.
				For example, every computer requires <a href="bios.html">a bus</a> that transmits data from one part of the computer to another.</p>

			<h2>PC Monitor</h2>
			<p>PC monitor is the piece of computer hardware that displays the video and graphics information generated by computer through the video card.
				We might say, that monitors are very similar to TV. </p>
			<p>Some facts about monitors:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A monitor, no matter the type, connects to either HDMI, DVI, or VGA port on the computer.</li>
				<li>Before purchasing a new monitor, make sure that both devices support the same type of connection.</li>
				<li>Monitors are not typically user serviceable. For your safety, it's not usually wise to open and work on a monitor.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>Monitor Description</h4>
			<p>Even though the monitor sits outside the main computer housing, it is an essential part of the complete system.
				Monitors come in two major types - LCD or CRT. CRT monitors look much like old-fashioned televisions and are very deep in size. 
				LCD monitors are much thinner, use less energy, and provide a greater graphics quality.
				LCD monitors have completely obsoleted CRT monitors due to their higher quality, smaller "footprint" on the desk, and decreasing price.
				Most monitors are in a widescreen format and range in size from 15" to 27" or more. This size is a diagonal measurement from one corner of the screen to the other.
				Monitors are built-in as part of the computer system in laptops, tablets, netbooks, and all-in-one desktop machines.</p>

			<h2>Keyboard</h2>
			<p>Keyboard is a set of typewriter-like keys that enables you to enter data into a computer and other devices. 
				Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys. 
				The keys typically used for computer keyboards are often classified as following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Alphanumeric keys: The letters and numbers on the keyboard.</li>
				<li>Punctuation keys: The comma, period, semicolon, and similar keys.</li>
				<li>Special keys: This includes the function keys, control keys, arrow keys, caps Lock key, and so on.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak and Other Keyboards</h4>
			<p>The standard layout of letters, numbers, and punctuation is known as a QWERTY keyboard. That is so because the first six keys on the top row of letters spell QWERTY.
				The QWERTY keyboard was designed in the 1800s for mechanical typewriters and was actually designed to slow typists down to avoid jamming the keys.</p>
			<p>The AZERTY keyboard is the French version of the standard QWERTY keyboard. AZERTY keyboards differ slightly from the QWERTY keyboard.</p>
			<p>Another keyboard design, which has letters positioned for speed typing, is the Dvorak keyboard.
				Unlike the traditional QWERTY keyboard, the Dvorak keyboard is designed so that the middle row of keys includes the most common letters.</p>

			<h2>Mouse</h2>
			<p>A device that controls the movement of the cursor or pointer on a display screen. A mouse is a small object you can roll along a hard, flat surface. Its name is derived from its shape, 
				which looks a bit like a mouse, its connecting wire that one can imagine to be the mouse's tail, and the fact that one must make it scurry along a surface. 
				As you move the mouse, the pointer on the display screen moves in the same direction.
				Mice contain at least one button and sometimes as many as three, which have different functions depending on what program is running. 
				Some newer mice also include a scroll wheel for scrolling through long documents.</p>
			<p>Invented by Douglas Engelbart of Stanford Research Center in 1963, and pioneered by Xerox in the 1970s, 
				the mouse is one of the great breakthroughs in computer ergonomics because it frees the user to a large extent from using the keyboard.
				In particular, the mouse is important for graphical user interfaces because you can simply point to options and objects and click a mouse button. 
				Such applications are often called point-and-click programs. The mouse is also useful for graphics programs that allow you to draw pictures by using the mouse like a pen, pencil, or paintbrush.</p>
			<p>There are three basic types of mice:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>mechanical: has a rubber or metal ball on its underside that can roll in all directions. 
					Mechanical sensors within the mouse detect the direction the ball is rolling and move the screen pointer accordingly.</li>
				<li>optomechanical: same as a mechanical mouse, but uses optical sensors to detect motion of the ball.</li>
				<li>optical: uses a laser to detect the mouse's movement. You must move the mouse along a special mat with a grid so that the optical mechanism has a frame of reference. 
					Optical mice have no mechanical moving parts. They respond more quickly and precisely than mechanical and optomechanical mice, but they are also more expensive.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Motherboard</h2>
			<p>The main circuit board of a microcomputer. <a href="bios.html">The motherboard</a> contains the connectors for attaching additional boards. Typically, the motherboard contains the <a href="cpu.html">CPU</a>, <a href="bios.html">BIOS</a>, <a href="memory.html">memory</a>, mass storage interfaces, 
				serial and parallel ports, expansion slots, and all the controllers required to control standard <a href="connection.html">peripheral devices</a>, such as the display screen, keyboard, and <a href="diskdrive.html">disk drive</a>. 
				Collectively, all these chips that reside on the motherboard are known as the motherboard's chipset.</p>
			<p>On most PCs, it is possible to add memory chips directly to the motherboard. You may also be able to upgrade to a faster PC by replacing the CPU chip. 
				To add additional core features, you may need to replace the motherboard entirely.
				Motherboard is sometimes abbreviated as mobo.</p>

			<h2>Power supply</h2>
			<p>Also called a power supply unit or PSU, the component that supplies power to a computer. Most personal computers can be plugged into standard electrical outlets. 
				The power supply then pulls the required amount of electricity and converts the AC current to DC current. It also regulates the voltage to eliminate spikes and surges common in most electrical systems. 
				Not all power supplies, however, do an adequate voltage-regulation job, so a computer is always susceptible to large voltage fluctuations.</p>
			<p>Power supplies are rated in terms of the number of watts they generate. The more powerful the computer, the more watts it can provide to components.</p>

			<h2>CPU</h2>
			<p><a href="cpu.html">CPU</a> (pronounced as separate letters) is the abbreviation forcentral processing unit.
				Sometimes referred to simply as the central processor, but more commonly called processor,
				the CPU is the brains of the computerwhere most calculations take place. In terms of computing power, the CPU is the most important element of a computer system.</p>
			<p>Two typical components of a CPU are the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The arithmetic logic unit (ALU), which performs arithmetic and logical operations.</li>
				<li>The control unit (CU), which extracts instructions from memory and decodes and executes them, calling on the ALU when necessary.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Memory</h2>
			<p>Internal storage areas in the computer. The term <a href="memory.html">memory</a> identifiesdata storage that comes in the form of chips, and the word storageis used for memory that exists on tapes or disks. 
				Moreover, the termmemory is usually used as a shorthand for physical memory, which refers to the actual chips capable of holding data. 
				Some computers also use virtual memory, which expands physical memory onto ahard disk.</p>
			<p>Every computer comes with a certain amount of physical memory, usually referred to as main memory or RAM. You can think of main memory as an array of boxes,
				ach of which can hold a single byteof information. A computer that has 1 megabyte of memory, therefore, can hold about 1 million bytes (orcharacters) of information.</p>
			<p>There are several different types of memory:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>RAM (random-access memory): This is the same as main memory. When used by itself, the termRAM refers to read and write memory; 
					that is, you can both write data into RAM and read data from RAM. This is in contrast to ROM, which permits you only to read data. 
					Most RAM is volatile, which means that it requires a steady flow of electricity to maintain its contents. As soon as the power is turned off, whatever data was in RAM is lost.</li>
				<li>ROM (read-only memory): Computers almost always contain a small amount of read-only memory that holds instructions for starting up the computer. Unlike RAM, ROM cannot be written to.</li>
				<li>PROM (programmable read-only memory): A PROM is a memory chip on which you can store aprogram. But once the PROM has been used, you cannot wipe it clean and use it to store something else. 
					Like ROMs, PROMs are non-volatile.</li>
				<li>EPROM (erasable programmable read-only memory): An EPROM is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to ultraviolet light.</li>
				<li>EEPROM (electrically erasable programmable read-only memory): An EEPROM is a special type of PROM that can be erased by exposing it to an electrical charge.</li>

			<h2>GPU</h2>
			<p>A GPU, or graphics processing unit, is used primarily for 3-Dapplications. It is a single-chip processor that creates lighting effects and transforms objects every time a 3D scene is redrawn. 
				These are mathematically-intensive tasks, which otherwise, would put quite a strain on the CPU. Lifting this burden from the CPU frees up cycles that can be used for other jobs.</p>
