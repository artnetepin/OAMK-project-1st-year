			<h2>Hard disk drive (HDD)</h2>
			<p>A hard disk drive (HDD), is a data storage device used for storing and retrieving digital information using one or more rigid ("hard") 
				rapidly rotating disks (platters) coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads arranged on a moving actuator arm, 
				which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored
				or retrieved in any order rather than sequentially. HDDs retain stored data even when powered off.</p>
			<p>Introduced by IBM in 1956, HDDs became the dominant secondary storage device for general-purpose computers by the early 1960s. Continuously improved,
				HDDs have maintained this position into the modern era of servers and personal computers. More than 200 companies have produced HDD units, 
				though most current units are manufactured by Seagate, Toshiba and Western Digital. Worldwide disk storage revenues were US $32 billion in 2013, down 3% from 2012.</p>
			<p>The primary characteristics of an HDD are its capacity and performance. Capacity is specified in unit prefixes corresponding to powers of 1000:
				a 1-terabyte (TB) drive has a capacity of 1,000 gigabytes (GB; where 1 gigabyte = 1 billion bytes).
				Typically, some of an HDD's capacity is unavailable to the user because it is used by the file system and the computer operating system, 
				and possibly inbuilt redundancy for error correction and recovery. Performance is specified by the time required to move the heads to a track or cylinder 
				(average access time) plus the time it takes for the desired sector to move under the head (average latency, 
				which is a function of the physical rotational speed in revolutions per minute), and finally the speed at which the data is transmitted (data rate).</p>
			<p>The two most common form factors for modern HDDs are 3.5-inch, for desktop computers, and 2.5-inch, primarily for laptops. 
				HDDs are connected to systems by standard interface cables such as PATA (Parallel ATA), SATA (Serial ATA), USB or SAS (Serial attached SCSI) cables.</p>
			<p>As of 2015, the primary competing technology for secondary storage is flash memory in the form of solid-state drives (SSDs), which have higher data transfer rates,
				better reliability, and significantly lower latency and access times, but HDDs remain the dominant medium for secondary storage due to advantages
				in price per bit and per-device recording capacity. However, SSDs are replacing HDDs where speed, power consumption and durability are more important considerations.</p>
			<h4>External hard disk drives</h4>
			<p>External hard disk drives typically connect via USB; variants using USB 2.0 interface generally have slower data transfer rates when compared 
				to internally mounted hard drives connected through SATA. Plug and play drive functionality offers system compatibility and features large storage
				options and portable design. As of March 2015, available capacities for external hard disk drives range from 500 GB to 8 TB.</p>
			<p>External hard disk drives are usually available as pre-assembled integrated products, but may be also assembled by combining an external enclosure 
				(with USB or other interface) with a separately purchased drive. They are available in 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch sizes; 
				2.5-inch variants are typically called portable external drives, while 3.5-inch variants are referred to as desktop external drives. 
				"Portable" drives are packaged in smaller and lighter enclosures than the "desktop" drives; additionally, 
				"portable" drives use power provided by the USB connection, while "desktop" drives require external power bricks.</p>
			<p>Features such as biometric security or multiple interfaces (for example, Firewire) are available at a higher cost. 
				There are pre-assembled external hard disk drives that, when taken out from their enclosures, cannot be used internally in a laptop or desktop computer due 
				to embedded USB interface on their printed circuit boards, and lack of SATA (or Parallel ATA) interfaces.</p>

			<h2>Solid-state drive (SSD)</h2>
			<p>A solid-state drive (SSD) contains neither an actual disk nor a drive motor to spin a disk) is a solid-state storage device that uses 
				integrated circuit assemblies as memory to store data persistently. SSD technology primarily uses electronic interfaces compatible with traditional 
				block input/output (I/O) hard disk drives, which permit simple replacements in common applications. Additionally, new I/O interfaces, like SATA Express,
				have been designed to address specific requirements of the SSD technology.</p>
			<p>SSDs have no moving (mechanical) components. This distinguishes them from traditional electromechanical magnetic disks such as hard disk drives (HDDs)
				or floppy disks, which contain spinning disks and movable read/write heads. Compared with electromechanical disks, SSDs are typically more resistant to physical shock,
				run silently, have lower access time, and less latency. However, while the price of SSDs has continued to decline over time, 
				consumer-grade SSDs are still roughly eight to nine times more expensive per unit of storage than consumer-grade HDDs.</p>
			<p>As of 2014, most SSDs use NAND-based flash memory, which retains data without power. For applications requiring fast access, 
				but not necessarily data persistence after power loss, SSDs may be constructed from random-access memory (RAM). 
				Such devices may employ separate power sources, such as batteries, to maintain data after power loss.</p>
			<p>Hybrid drives or solid-state hybrid drives (SSHDs) combine the features of SSDs and HDDs in the same unit, 
				containing a large hard disk drive and an SSD cache to improve performance of frequently accessed data.</p>
			<h4>Comparing HDD and SSD</h4>
			<p>Making a comparison between SSDs and ordinary (spinning) HDDs is difficult. Traditional HDD benchmarks tend to focus on the performance characteristics 
				that are poor with HDDs, such as rotational latency and seek time. As SSDs do not need to spin or seek to locate data, they may prove vastly superior to HDDs 
				in such tests. However, SSDs have challenges with mixed reads and writes, and their performance may degrade over time. SSD testing must start 
				from the (in use) full disk, as the new and empty (fresh out of the box) disk may have much better write performance than it would show after only weeks of use.</p>
			<p>Most of the advantages of solid-state drives over traditional hard drives are due to their ability to access data completely 
				electronically instead of electromechanically, resulting in superior transfer speeds and mechanical ruggedness. On the other hand, 
				hard disk drives offer significantly higher capacity for their price.</p>
			<p>Field failure rates indicate that SSDs are significantly more reliable than HDDs. However, SSDs are uniquely sensitive to sudden power interruption,
				resulting in aborted writes or even cases of the complete loss of the drive. The reliability of both HDDs and SSDs varies greatly amongst models.</p>
			<p>In traditional HDDs, a re-written file will generally occupy the same location on the disk surface as the original file, 
				whereas in SSDs the new copy will often be written to different NAND cells for the purpose of wear leveling. 
				The wear-leveling algorithms are complex and difficult to test exhaustively; as a result, one major cause of data loss in SSDs is firmware bugs.</p>

			<h2>Optical disc drive (ODD)</h2>
			<p>Optical disc drive (ODD) is a disk drive that uses laser light or electromagnetic waves within or near the visible light spectrum as part of the process
				of reading or writing data to or from optical discs. Some drives can only read from certain discs, but recent drives can both read and record, 
				also called burners or writers. Compact discs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs are common types of optical media which can be read and recorded by such drives.
				Optical disc drives that are no longer in production include CD-ROM drive, CD writer drive, and combo (CD-RW/DVD-ROM) drive. As of 2015,
				DVD writer drive is the most common for desktop PCs and laptops. There are also DVD-ROM drive, BD-ROM drive, Blu-ray Disc combo drive,
				and Blu-ray Disc writer drive which are not so much demand in the market.</p>
			<p>Optical disc drives are an integral part of standalone appliances such as CD players, VCD players, DVD players, Blu-ray disc players, DVD recorders, 
				certain desktop video game consoles, such as Sony PlayStation 4, Microsoft Xbox One, and Nintendo Wii U, and certain portable video game consoles, 
				such as Sony PlayStation Portable. They are also very commonly used in computers to read software and consumer media distributed on disc,
				and to record discs for archival and data exchange purposes. Floppy disk drives, with capacity of 1.44 MB, have been made obsolete: 
				optical media are cheap and have vastly higher capacity to handle the large files used since the days of floppy discs, 
				and the vast majority of computers and much consumer entertainment hardware have optical writers. USB flash drives, high-capacity, small, and inexpensive,
				are suitable where read/write capability is required.</p>
			<p>Disc recording is restricted to storing files playable on consumer appliances (films, music, etc.), relatively small volumes of data
				(e.g., a standard DVD holds 4.7 gigabytes) for local use, and data for distribution, but only on a small scale; 
				mass-producing large numbers of identical discs is cheaper and faster than individual recording.</p>
			<p>Optical discs are used to back up relatively small volumes of data, but backing up of entire hard drives, as of 2015, 
				typically containing many hundreds of gigabytes or even multiple terabytes, is less practical than with the smaller capacities previously available. 
				Large backups are often made on external hard drives, as their price has dropped to a level making this viable;
				in professional environments magnetic tape drives are also used.</p>
